# IACRF
Here, we propose a novel strategy __Integrating _Ab-initio_ Calculations with Random Forest__ (IACRF) to optimize the RF model, thereby estimating the corrosion rate of Al alloys in diverse environments. Based on the thermodynamic assessment of the secondary phases, the ab-initio calculation quantities, especially the work function, significantly improved the prediction accuracy with respect to small-sample Al alloys corrosion dataset.
