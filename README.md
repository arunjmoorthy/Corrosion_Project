# IACRF
Here, we propose a novel strategy Integrating Ab-initio Calculations with Random Forest (IACRF) to optimize the RF model, thereby estimating the corrosion rate of Al alloys in diverse environments. Based on the thermodynamic assessment of the secondary phases, the ab-initio calculation quantities, especially the work function, significantly improved the prediction accuracy with respect to small-sample Al alloys corrosion dataset.
